## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I focused on working with grids and it turned out easier that I would've excepted. I worked with min and max width/height properties and upped up my responsive CSS skills.


### Useful resources

- [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdBOoK3Pfw) - This helped me with an idea of transitions, but I couldn't work out a way of an infite loop. I'll come back to this assignment to try and perfect it.
